# NBAPlayerMovements
A D3 visualization of NBA player movement data collected during the 2015-16 season.

To run this visualization, you will first need to download the data which can be found here: https://github.com/linouk23/NBA-Player-Movements.  In the data folder of the linked repo, there are 7z files that you will need to extract into json files and dump them into the data folder of this repo.

Then, from the home directory, start an http server (e.g., for Python 3, run "python3 -m http.server") and point your browser at the given address.

Currently, the code will run through one "play" of the chosen game.  You can explore the different plays by changing the source code.
